    log-lines = 25; # Default: 10

    # When free disk space in /nix/store drops below min-free during a build,
    # Nix performs a garbage-collection until max-free bytes are available or there is no more garbage.

    # If set to true, Nix will fall back to building from source if a binary substitute fails.

    # If set to true, Nix automatically detects files in the store that have identical contents,
    # and replaces them with hard links to a single copy. This saves disk space.
    # If set to false (the default), you can still run nix-store –optimise to get rid of duplicate files.

    # rather than after every build.

    # In general, outputs must be registered as roots separately.
    # However, even if the output of a derivation is registered as a root,
    # the collector will still delete store paths that are used only at build time
    # (e.g., the C compiler, or source tarballs downloaded from the network).
    # To prevent it from doing so, set this option to true.
