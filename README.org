#+TITLE: montchr/dotfield

This is Dotfield: my system configuration, some of my worlds as a Nix flake.
Primarily for macOS right now, but gradually introducing NixOS
configurations as well.

* Setup

** Bootstrap Script

On macOS, run the following as the administrative user:

#+begin_src bash
bash -c "$(curl -LsS https://raw.githubusercontent.com/montchr/dotfield/main/bootstrap)"
#+end_src

On Linux, run the following as root, reboot, and run again as the sudo user.

#+begin_src bash
bash -c "$(wget -qO - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/montchr/dotfield/main/bootstrap)"
#+end_src

*** Auto Setup with Environment Variables

Set the values at the beginning of the provisioning script.
